    // Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory.
    // Rust has two kinds of ownership:
    // 1. Owned: A value that is owned by a particular owner.
    // 2. Borrowed: A value that is owned by a context that grants you permission to use it.

    // Stack and Heap
    // Stack: A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of FIXED SIZE data.
    // Heap: A heap is a data structure that stores a collection of VARIABLE SIZE data. It is slower than a stack.

    // Ownership Rules
    // 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
    // 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    // 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    // Reference rules
    // 1. At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    // 2. References must always be valid.
